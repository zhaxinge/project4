## Block the Wind

### Introduction

Taking Qingdao Excellence World Financial Center as an example, this case focuses on the impact of high-rise wind brought by high-rise buildings. It intends to provide effective and high-quality outdoor space for the region through the control and coordination of landscape units. Combined with the theory and practical methods of Landscape Urbanism, this case uses the site as a sample of solutions to the noise problem of urban parks and open spaces, and conducts prototype study and design of the universal strategy for such problems.

Based on the wind rating, the function type and the proportion of usersï¼Œthe numer of different prototypes is obtained. Finally, the placement of different prototypes is determined according to the connectivity of the site and the surrounding environment and different traffic conditions.

####   Prototype Applied To The Site

A set of "wind abatement modulus" is generated through the planning of the plane activity unit and the wind blocking profile of different levels. These prototypes can be used in future designs. The classification and analysis of terrain, plants, and activity spaces can be continued, and the prototype design combination could be carried out, developed and expanded to get a set of site plots. The design schemes can be applied to sites with similar problems. Other urban sites with similar high-rise wind issues design can refer to the design ideas and plant selection strategies of this case.

### Thoughts

Most of these rapidly-built urban real estate signs lack detailed planning and careful consideration.The incompatibility of super-scale and street space neglects the comfort and matching of outdoor spaces, especially the construction of super-complexes affects urban ecological factors such as wind, light, heat, etc.Thus, even if the corresponding space is greened and landscaped, it is difficult for people to effectively use the outdoor green space due to the wind impact of the building on the overall environment.

A set of "wind abatement modulus" is generated through the planning of
the plane activity unit and the wind blocking profile of different levels. These prototypes can be used in future designs. The classification and analysis of terrain, plants, and activity spaces can be continued, and the prototype design combination could be carried out, developed and expanded to get a set of site plots. The design schemes can be applied to sites with similar problems. Other urban sites with similar high-rise wind issues design can refer to the design ideas and plant selection strategies of this case. Combine their own internal and external activity needs to enrich the prototype proposed, and finally form a mature design plan.
